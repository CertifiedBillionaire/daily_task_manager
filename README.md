## **Part 0: Getting Started - Opening Your Terminal and Creating Your Project**

Before we can create any files or install any software for your app, we need to open a special program on your computer called the "Terminal" (on macOS and Linux) or "Command Prompt" / "PowerShell" (on Windows). This is a text-based window where you can type commands for your computer directly, instead of clicking icons.

### Step 0.1: How to Open the Terminal / Command Prompt

**On Windows Computers:**

1.  **Click on the "Start" button** (usually in the bottom-left corner of your screen).
2.  **Type `cmd`** (which stands for "Command Prompt") into the search bar.
3.  **Press Enter** on your keyboard, or click on "Command Prompt" in the search results.

    * **Alternative on Windows (PowerShell):** You can also search for `PowerShell` and open it. It's similar to Command Prompt but has more powerful features. Either one will work for our purposes.

**On Apple macOS Computers:**

1.  **Click on the "Spotlight Search" icon** (a magnifying glass, usually in the top-right corner of your screen).
2.  **Type `Terminal`** into the search bar.
3.  **Press Enter** on your keyboard, or click on "Terminal" in the search results.

**On Linux Computers (like Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.):**

1.  **Look for an "Activities" button** (often in the top-left corner), or a search bar in your taskbar.
2.  **Type `Terminal`** into the search bar.
3.  **Press Enter** or click on "Terminal" in the search results.
    * **Tip:** Often, you can also press `Ctrl + Alt + T` simultaneously as a shortcut to open the terminal.

### What You Should See When You Open It:

Once you open it, you'll see a dark or white window with text, and usually a blinking cursor, like this:
